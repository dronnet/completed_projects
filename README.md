| Name Project  | Description   | Libraries   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Churn_clients_21_08_2022   |  It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. You are provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.  |  pandas, numpy, matplotlib, os, sklearn  |
| Churn_clients_hotel_26_09_2022   | Development of a system that predicts the cancellation of a hotel reservation. | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, os, seaborn, sklearn, scipy |
| Find_toxic_03_05_2023   | We need to create a tool that will look for toxic comments and send them for moderation. | os, numpy, pandas, spacy, torch, transformers, tqdm, sklearn, catboost, re |
| Protection_data_clients_13_01_2023   | It is necessary to protect the data of the clients of the insurance company. Development of such a method of data transformation so that it is difficult to recover personal information from them. | pandas, numpy, sklearn |
| Research_film_13_06_2022   | It is necessary to study the Russian film distribution market and identify current trends. The data set contains information about distribution certificates, box office and government support for films, as well as information from the KinoPoisk website. | pandasm, numpy, matplotlib, os |
| Research_reliability_borrowers_02_05_2022   | It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers | pandas |
| Research_sale_apartm_23_05_2022   | It is necessary to learn how to determine the market value of real estate objects. The task is to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity. | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, os |
| Star_temperature_pred_27_03_2023   | Star temperature prediction. The task from the observatory: to figure out how to use a neural network to determine the temperature on the surface of the discovered stars. | pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, random, math, sklearn, torchmetrics, torch, scorch |
| Tariff_recommendation_01_08_2022   | The mobile operator found out: many customers use archival tariffs. They want to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer users a new rate.

In this paper, a model is constructed for a classification problem that will select an appropriate rate. | pandas, numpy, os, sklearn |
| Taxi_Order_Prediction_18_04_2023   | There is historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. In this work, I built a model for such a prediction. | os, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn |
| accident_risk_02_04_2023   | Creation of a system that could assess the risk of an accident along a selected route. Risk is the probability of an accident with any damage to the vehicle. Once a driver has booked a car, got behind the wheel, and chosen a route, the system must assess the level of risk. If the risk level is high, the driver will see a warning and route recommendations. | random, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sqlalchemy, sklearn, catboost, lightgbm, phik |
| cost_cars_23_01_2023   | There is historical data: technical characteristics, configurations and prices of cars. A model for determining the cost has been developed. | os, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, catboost, lightgbm |
| location_oil_well_11_09_2022   | It is necessary to decide where to drill a new well.

There are oil samples in three regions: in each 10,000 deposits, where they measured the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves. A machine learning model has been built that will help determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. | pandas, numpy, numpy, matplotlib, os, sklearn, scipy |
